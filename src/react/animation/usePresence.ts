 * Holds a subtree long enough for its exit to run, then lets it go. React removes a node the instant it
 * stops rendering it, which is why `startingStyle` can animate an entrance with no JavaScript and nothing
 * can animate an exit: by the time the styles would change, the element is already gone.
 *
 * **The wait is the duration the element's own CSS declares**, read off the node the moment the exit
 * starts. `transitionend` would be more precise but fires once per property with no way to know how many
 * are coming, so the first one cuts a two-property exit short — and a transition that never starts fires
 * nothing at all, so an event-driven wait needs this timer as a backstop anyway. One mechanism, sized from
 * the real CSS: a zero duration (nothing declared, or `prefers-reduced-motion`) unmounts in the same commit.
