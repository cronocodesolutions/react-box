/**
 * The exit half of the animation story: it keeps rendering its child with `present: false` until the
 * child's own CSS says its transition is over, and only then lets React remove it. `startingStyle` is the
 * entrance and needs no JavaScript at all — this is the ~1 KB the other direction costs, because React
 * unmounts synchronously and there is nothing left to transition.
 *
 * ```tsx
 * <Presence present={open}>
 *   {({ present, ref, props }) => (
 *     <Box ref={ref} props={props} opacity={present ? 1 : 0} startingStyle={{ opacity: 0 }} transitionDuration={200} />
 *   )}
 * </Presence>
 * ```
 *
 * A render prop rather than a cloned child, for the same reason `Tooltip`'s trigger is one: the child has
 * to be told which way it is going, and cloning would have to guess where a `data-state` belongs — a Box
 * takes DOM attributes in a `props` bag, a plain element takes them on top. The `ref` is not decoration
 * either: whichever element it lands on is the one whose computed style the wait is measured from, so it
 * belongs on the element that carries the transition.
