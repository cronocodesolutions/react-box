/**
 * Every component, rendered the way its docs show it, put through axe. The gate is two-sided: an
 * unlisted rule that fires fails the build, and a listed rule that no longer fires fails it too, so the
 * ledger cannot turn into excuses. What it cannot notice is *missing* semantics — a listbox built from
 * bare `<div>`s looks clean — which is what the APG keyboard tests beside this file are for.
